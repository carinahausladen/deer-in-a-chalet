# Deer-in-a-Chalet: Lecture Code Repository

This repository contains Python scripts that accompany our lecture on probabilistic modeling and topic modeling. Each file provides hands-on examples and challenges to deepen your understanding.

## Contents

### 1. **Gibbs Sampling Walkthrough (`Gibbs_sampling.py`)**
This script walks you through the exact Gibbs sampling process we discussed in class.  
Additionally, it includes a challenge: **try to make the Gibbs sampler converge!**

### 2. **Dirichlet Distribution Animation (`dirichlet_animation_symmetric.py` & `dirichlet_animation_asymmetric.py`)**
These scripts demonstrate the Dirichlet distribution under different hyperparameter specifications (symmetric and asymmetric).  
They generate GIF animations, allowing you to visualize how the prior distribution transforms with different parameter choices.

### 3. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Example (`lda_example.py`)**
This script implements the simple LDA example from the beginning of the lecture, where we attempted to extract two topics from a set of documents.  
Unlike in the lecture, where we analyzed pseudo-code, this script **fully runs** and includes the necessary preprocessing steps, such as tokenization and stopword removal.



Happy modeling! ðŸš€
